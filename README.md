# SonosStream
Simple streaming of audio from a device running Windows Vista or above to a Sonos speaker.

I originally wrote this to stream audio from my laptop to my Sonos speaker for watching movies and playing games.

Currently there's a fair bit of latency from the streaming device to the Sonos; there's a [bug](https://github.com/deanward81/SonosStream/issues/4) open to address that in the near future. As a result this isn't currently suitable for streaming things where you expect immediate feedback. It works fine for playing music and other things that don't need true realtime streaming.
